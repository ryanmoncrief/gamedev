<p>
 The metric system provides a consistent set of units for scientific measurement of the world. Though often associated with the French Revolution or with Napoleon, the system of metric units only really began to displace existing units in May 1875, when it was made official by an international treaty. In 1960, it was renamed the &quot;Système international d'unités&quot;, which is usually abbreviated &quot;SI&quot;.
<p>
 This extension is a kit for writers who want to make realistic simulations, backed up by some quantitative physics. It defines kinds of values for the 25 or so SI units in common usage, and more than 100 notations for them. It also makes sure they multiply correctly. For instance, a mass times an acceleration produces a force, so
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> say &quot;You feel a force of [2kg times 5 m/ss].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 will produce the text &quot;You feel a force of 10N.&quot; The easiest way to see how all these units combine is to run one of the examples below and look at the Kinds index which results.
<p>
 For each unit, both names and notations are allowed. Thus '2 kilograms' is equivalent to '2kg'. Both English and French spellings of 'meter'/'metre' and 'liter'/'litre' are allowed, but we insist on 'gram' not 'gramme' and 'tonne' not 'ton'. ('Ton' is too easily confused with the Imperial measure, which is not quite the same.) We can print back the same value in a variety of ways. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> say &quot;[m0 in metric units]&quot;;<br> say &quot;[m0 in kg]&quot;;<br> say &quot;[m0 in g]&quot;;<br> say &quot;[m0 in kilograms]&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 might produce: '2.04kg', '2.04kg', '2040g', '2.04 kilograms'. The text expansion '... in metric units' prints any value of any of these units in its most natural notation: 2.04kg is thought to be better than 2040g, but 981g would be better than 0.981kg. Or in the case of our variant spellings:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> say &quot;[C in metric units]&quot;;<br> say &quot;[C in milliliters]&quot;;<br> say &quot;[C in millilitres]&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 might produce '47 ml', '47 milliliters', '47 millilitres'. It's also worth remembering that any value can be rounded:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> say &quot;[C to the nearest 5 ml]&quot;;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 would produce '45 ml', for instance.
<p>
 For detailed notes on each of the units, consult the Kinds index for any project using this extension.
<p>
 We haven't included every SI unit. There are hundreds of kinds of value which turn up in physics, and we only include the commonest 25 or so. The missing ones which have named SI units are:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> angle (measured in radians), solid angle (measured in steradians), luminous flux (lux), electric capacitance (Farads), electric resistance (Ohms), electric conductance (Siemens), magnetic flux (Webers), magnetic field (Teslas), inductance (Henries), radioactivity (Becquerels), absorbed radioactive dose (Grays), equivalent radioactive dose (Sieverts), chemical quantity (mole), catalytic activity (katals).</font></blockquote>
<p>
 As can be seen, we've missed out units for chemistry, electromagnetic effects beyond the basic ones, and radioactivity. It would be easy to add any of these which might be needed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Electric resistance is a kind of value.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> 1.0 Ohm (in metric units, in Ohms, singular) or 2 Ohms (in metric units, in Ohms, plural) specifies an electric resistance.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Electric resistance times electric current specifies a voltage.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Similarly, there are many kinds of value which don't have named SI units, but where physicists write them down as compounds. These are also easy to add as needed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Angular momentum is a kind of value.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> 1.0 Nms specifies an angular momentum.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Momentum times length specifies an angular momentum.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Besides angular momentum, 'Metric Units' also leaves out:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> volumetric flow (cu m/s), jerk (m/sss), snap (m/ssss), angular velocity (rad/s, though Inform would probably use degrees/s), torque (Nm), wavenumber (1/m), specific volume (cu m/kg), molar volume (cu m/mole), molar heat capacity (J/K/mol), molar energy (J/mol), specific energy (J/kg), energy density (J/cu m), surface tension (J/sq m), thermal conductivity (W/m/C), viscosity (sq m/s), conductivity (S/m), permittivity (F/m), permeability (H/m), electric field strength (V/m), magnetic field strength (A/m), resistivity (Ohm metre).</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This extension is pretty faithful to SI conventions. It chooses centigrade rather than Kelvin for temperature, but otherwise it's strictly metric, and does not define Imperial measures. See the example below for how to add these.
<p>
 Example: ** Galileo, Galileo - Dropping a cannonball or a feather from a variety of heights.
<p>
 This experiment was first proposed in Pisa in the 1630s, but more definitively carried out by the crew of Apollo 15 in 1971, using a geological hammer and the feather of a falcon. Galileo's point was that heavy objects and light objects fall at the same speed because of gravity, and that only air resistance makes us think feathers fall more slowly than cannonballs. (Of course, heavy objects do land harder; the hammer kicked up a lot more lunar dust than the feather did.)

<p>
 Note the way Inform is able to solve the conservation equation, which says the potential energy at the start equals the kinetic energy at the end, to find the velocity v: this involves taking a square root, but it all happens automatically. Square roots tend to cause rounding errors - so on Mars the cannon ball and feather actually land 0.02s apart, in the calculation above, despite Galileo. But no human observer would notice that discrepancy.
<p>
 Example: ** The Empire Strikes Back - Using good old Imperial measures of length and area alongside these Frenchified metric ones.
<p>
 Imperial measures, often going back to obscure customs in Anglo-Saxon England, were inflicted across much of the world in the heyday of the British Empire. Some are still very much alive in England and its former colonies (Australia, India, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland, the USA and so on) - miles and feet, for instance. Others continue only in unscientific social customs, like sport: horse-races are measured in furlongs; the running distance between the two wickets of a cricket pitch is 22 yards, which is 1 chain exactly; and even in France, a football goal must be 8 feet high and 8 yards wide.

 The above conversions are based on 1 inch equals 2.5cm, which is not very accurate: 2.54cm would be closer. But to get that accuracy we would need to represent lengths down to 0.4mm, which is below the 1mm cutoff imposed by 'Metric Units'. We'll accept this 2% error in lengths (or 4% error in areas) as harmless, given that we're not going to be doing any serious calculations in Imperial units; if we were, we'd do better to make a fresh extension for them.

 Confusions still cause spectacular failures, as when an Air Canada ground crew mixed up pounds and kilograms and fuelled a Boeing 767 so lightly in 1983 that it ran dry at 41,000 feet, losing all engines, avionics and electricity. The captain, by great good luck also an amateur glider pilot, made a now-legendary landing at an obscure airstrip which the first officer by great good luck had once flown from. The USA's Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft, whose navigation software confused pounds and newtons, was not so lucky and burned up in the Martian atmosphere in 1998 at a cost of $330 million.
