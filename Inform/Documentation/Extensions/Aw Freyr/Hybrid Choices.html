 Chapter: Introduction
<p>
 This extension is inspired by and heavily adapted from the Adventure Book extension by Edward Griffiths. It features the ability to switch freely between CYOA and interactive modes, has an easily modifiable parser, and better memory economy. If you are familiar with Adventure Book, you will notice a number of similarities. Pages are &quot;pages&quot;, and the relations are familiar if named differently. There are also significant differences. Choices are no longer separate objects, but integrated as a part of the page. Rulebooks provide a more flexible and modular approach to altering the extension's default behavior.
<p>
 Section: A Note About the Repeated Description Bug
<p>
 Some people have reported duplicated room and page descriptions for a while. I've seen this myself, and I was aware of the problem, but because I am a lazy developer crushed by a demanding and poorly-paying day job, I just haven't had the chance to sit down and fix it until now. Now this is the patch. Rather, this is patch produced by lazily copy-pasting Vince Laviano's fix directly into the extension (thanks random forum guy!). Still, some of these are really beyond my paltry powers, so I'm going to go over three scenarios where you might encounter repeated text and their fixes.
<p>
 Scenario 1: Moving the player, as in &quot;now the player is in Hogwarts&quot; will always print a room description, and in the case of CYOA mode will actually print the page description twice. This is hard-coded behavior, and as much as there should be a &quot;Moving the Player to&quot; activity, there isn't. The only way to prevent this is the use of the phrase &quot;move the player to Hogwarts, without printing a room description&quot;. You could also use the &quot;cyoa teleport to Hogwarts&quot; phrase included in this extension.
<p>
 Scenario 2: If you are getting repeated page descriptions in the beginning of the game, you are probably using &quot;When play begins: switch to cyoa at p1.&quot; instead of the proper &quot;Instead of looking for the first time: switch to cyoa at p1.&quot; Again, looking at the very beginning of a game is pretty much hardcoded behavior, and there's nothing I can do to prevent it (or really should). Alternatively, you can use the &quot;without looking&quot; phrase option to suppress any duplicated page description, as in &quot;switch to cyoa at p1, without looking&quot;.
<p>
 Scenario 3: Using a page-toggle rule to exit CYOA as opposed to simply labeling a page as an end-page will cause the room description to print twice. It is recommended you use the end-page property rather than a page-toggle rule, but if for some reason you need to use the page-toggle rules, you can use &quot;switch from cyoa, without looking&quot; as a temporary fix.

 Chapter: What is Hybrid CYOA
<p>
 Hybrid CYOA is a CYOA menu-based system that can switch back to interactive modes. At the top level, it simply presents the player with a passage and a list of options.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The murderer brandishes a wicked knife at you. What will you do?</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> 1) Fight back!<br> 2) Freeze!<br> 3) Run away!</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The player can type one of the selected options. That option leads to more options.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;1</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> What weapon will you use?</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> 1) Fists.<br> 2) Sword.<br> 3) Grenade.</font></blockquote>
<p>
... and sometimes they won't.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;3</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> You toss the grenade and kill both yourself and the murderer.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> *** YOU DIED ***</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Where Hybrid Choices gets very powerful is how it interacts with the normal parser mode we are all familiar with. Hybrid Choices has the ability to swap back and forth, allowing you to have sequences of CYOA punctuated by normal Interactive Fiction goodness.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Where do you want to travel?</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> 1) London<br> 2) New York<br> 3) Sydney</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;3</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> You take a plane to Sydney.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> You stand before the Sydney Opera House, north of you, and the Government House is to the south. Southwest is a pleasant promenade with shops, and southeast heads off into a beach.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This is really only scratching the surface. There are detailed examples at the end of the document which demonstrate different things you can accomplish with Hybrid Choices. Have fun!
<p>
 Chapter: Basic Usage
<p>
 Section: Starting up CYOA
<p>
 Hybrid Choices allows an author to seamlessly switch between the the Inform parser and a flexible choice-based adventure mode. You can do this by invoking this phrase:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">... switch to cyoa at (PAGE)...</font></blockquote>
<p>
... Where PAGE is where you want the player to start making choices.
<p>
 If you want the player to start CYOA mode immediately on starting the game, simply drop in this code:
<p>
<script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode1002(code) {
    var myProject = project();

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('[=0x000A=]Instead of looking for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]switch to cyoa at YOURPAGEHERE.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode1002()"><img border=0 src=inform:/doc_images/paste.png></a><blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of looking for the first time:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; switch to cyoa at YOURPAGEHERE.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Returning from CYOA mode is done via an &quot;end-page&quot; which will be explained later.
<p>
 Section: Simple Choices
<p>
 We can imagine a page as a passage in our favorite adventure books of yore. When we write a &quot;page&quot;, this is like a passage in our story.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The first junction is a page.<br> &quot;The tunnel goes left and right.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This is the simplest page possible. Presumably, it is the first page in our book.
<p>
 Now we can add some choices.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The left tunnel is a page.<br> &quot;You go left and find yourself in a long corridor.&quot;<br> The cdesc is &quot;Go left.&quot;. It is for the first junction.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The right tunnel is a page.<br> &quot;You go right and find yourself in a large cave. A little stream runs through it.&quot;<br> The cdesc is &quot;Go right.&quot;. It is for the first junction.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Some notes here. The CDESC stands for &quot;CHOICE DESCRIPTION&quot;, and it is what is displayed when this page is offered as a choice.
<p>
 The second thing you'll notice is that the choice is &quot;for the first junction&quot;. This indicates that his page is a choice for the first junction. This is short for &quot;The first junction turns to this page&quot;.
<p>
 Flexible CYOA handles multiple pages just fine.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The easy choice is a page.<br> &quot;You make the easy choice.&quot;<br> The cdesc is &quot;Do the easy thing.&quot; It is for page1, page2, page3, page4...</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section: Flipping Pages
<p>
 Flipped pages are pages we read through but don't &quot;stop&quot; on. We see the passage but then move onto a new page immediately, a very useful function for long passages.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> p1 is a page.<br> &quot;You keep going...&quot;<br> It flips to p2.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> p2 is a page.<br> &quot;...and going...&quot;<br> It flips to p3.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> p3 is a page.<br> &quot;...and going!&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Hybrid Choices will not bother printing choices for p1 or p2, because we've told I7 to print these pages but immediately skip past them. This comes with a risk. If Hybrid Choices detects that we've written an infinite loop, like this...
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> p1 is a page.<br> &quot;You keep going...&quot;<br> It flips to p2.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> p2 is a page.<br> &quot;...and going...&quot;<br> It flips to p3.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> p3 is a page.<br> &quot;...and going...&quot;<br> It flips to p4.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> p4 is a page.<br> &quot;...and going...&quot;<br> It flips to P2.</font></blockquote>
<p>
... Then it will failsafe to the last page where choices were offered, in this case it would be the last page that turned to P1.
<p>
 Section: Menus, One-Offs and Dead-Ends
<p>
 Pages need not have any content. Somtimes they are useful for just presenting a series of options.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The menu is a page.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Now we can refer back to this menu with our other choices.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> AskAboutPizza is a page.<br> &quot;'What about pizza?' you ask.<br><br>Jenny frowns. 'No, I had some for lunch yesterday.'&quot;<br> The cdesc is &quot;Ask about pizza.&quot; It is for the menu. It is a dead-end. It is one-off.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> AskAboutWine is a page.<br> &quot;'What about wine?' you ask.<br><br>Jenny frowns. 'No, I have to drive home tonight.'&quot;<br> The cdesc is &quot;Ask about wine.&quot; It is for the menu. It is a dead-end. It is one-off.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 A page defined as a &quot;dead-end&quot; will return to the original page that sent it there, even through multiple flipped pages! Very useful for menus.
<p>
 The second adjective you see is &quot;one-off&quot;. This ensures that, once this choice is picked, it will never be displayed again.
<p>
 Section: Page Control
<p>
 Sometimes, even when a page turns to another, we might not want to offer it as a choice. Hybrid Choices offers a number of ways to control which choices are displayed based on previous choices. One way we can control this is through use of the &quot;cancel&quot; and &quot;need&quot; relations.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> P1 is a page.<br> &quot;There is a door. On the wall is a switch that says, 'FLIP TO DISABLE TRAP'.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> P2 is a page.<br> &quot;You flip the switch. Hmm... you feel imperceptibly safer.&quot;<br> The cdesc is &quot;Flip the switch.&quot; It is for P1. It is a dead end. It is one off.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> P3 is a page.<br> &quot;You travel through the door and are murdered by traps.&quot;<br> The cdesc is &quot;Saunter through the door.&quot; It is canceled by P2. It is for P1.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> P4 is a page.<br> &quot;You safely travel throug the door.&quot;<br> The cdesc is &quot;Saunter through the door.&quot; It is needed by P2. It is for P1.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 When a page X &quot;cancels&quot; a page Y, it removes page Y from ever being considered as a choice if page X is visited. When a page X &quot;needs&quot; a page Y, page X will never be considered until page Y is visited. This works for multiple pages, but in a slightly different ways. All of a page's needed pages need to be visited before it becomes a viable choice. However, only one of a page's canceled pages need to be visited to cancel that page.
<p>
 The second method is by &quot;activating/deactivating&quot; pages. A page is either &quot;active&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot;. When it is &quot;inactive&quot;, it will not be displayed as a choice. You can do this with a phrase.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">... activate PAGE...<br>... deactivate PAGE...</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This will toggle the page. You can even do this in groups. Say we have a game where pages are identifiable by color.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> After examining the anti-red:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;All that anti-red sears out your eyeballs.&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deactivate red pages;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; activate ultra-green pages.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This is also useful for the page-toggle rulebook, which will be covered later.
<p>
 Section: End-Page
<p>
 An end-page, when read, will return the player to the normal parser interface.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> ChoicesAreDone is a page.<br> &quot;OK, you've finished doing all your choices. Go back to your typety-typety i-can-do-anything-but-disambiguate parser world and you'll find that rope has now been secured to both the tree AND the horse cart with minimal fuss.&quot;<br> The cdesc is &quot;Finish.&quot; It is an end-page.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The original parser will be fully active, and for all purposes it becomes a classic IF game. A location description will be printed, and the game will resume following the every turn rules.
<p>
 Chapter: Advanced Topics
<p>
 Hybrid Choices has four main rulebooks: choice-switch, page-switch, page-toggle and page-output.
<p>
 Section: Choice-Switch
<p>
 The choice-switch rules dictate whether a page will be offered as a choice. This provides a much finer level of control than the methods of page control outlined above as you can pretty much dictate whatever you want.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A choice-switch rule for the banana page:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unless the player carries a banana:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule fails.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 If the rule fails, the page is suppressed as a choice. If the rule succeeds, the choice is immediately displayed, even if another, later rule would have eliminated it as a choice.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A choice-switch rule for the magic page:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the player spoke the magic words:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule succeeds.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Here, the magic page is always offered as long as the player spoke the words, *even* if the page is inactive or canceled by an earlier page. This can be very useful.
<p>
 Section: Page-Switch
<p>
 It is possible at certain points to swap out the page you are currently looking at. This is the purpose of the page-switch. This rulebook switches out one page for another when called. It is useful when you have one choice that has many possibilities depending on the game state, or if you have an event that would stop the player immediately.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The p1 is a page.<br> &quot;You are in front of the extra-dimensional door. There is but one thing to do...&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The p2 is a page.<br> The cdesc is &quot;Open the door.&quot; It is for p1.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A page-switch rule for p2:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let X be a random number between 1 and 6;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if X is 1:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the current page is InHell;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if X is 2:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the current page is InHeaven;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if X is 3:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the current page is SomewhereInMongolia;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if X is 4:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the current page is InTheVacuumOfSpace;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if X is 5:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the current page is AtYourParents;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if X is 6:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the current page is StormingNormandyBeach.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 As you can see, the page-switch rule works by changing the &quot;current page&quot; at the very last minute. The &quot;current page&quot; is whatever page is being currently processed.
<p>
 Section: Page-Toggle
<p>
 The page-toggle is used specifically to interact with the model world. It is the bread-and-butter method to give inventory items, adjust the model world, change truth states, etc.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A page-toggle rule for TakeTheBanana:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the player carries the banana.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 You can also move the player by using the page-toggle rule.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A page-toggle rule for ElevatorToThirdFloor:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cyoa teleport to Third Floor.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 CYOA teleport is used to prevent duplicated text, but is essentially identical to &quot;now the player is in the third floor&quot;.
<p>
 Section: Page-Output
<p>
 Often, the description is not enough for truly complex pages. If you want something with really complicated prose, the page-output rule is where to put it.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A page-output rule for ReallyBoringSpeech:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;[one of]'Read my lips, no new bad things.'[or]'I desire peace between humans and fish.'[or]'I am not a crook.'[at random]&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 If there is also a description, that will also be printed after the page-output rules fire.
<p>
 Section: Choice-Displaying
<p>
 Normally, a cdesc is the same no matter where it is displayed. The choice-displaying activity determines what is printed when a page is displayed as a choice. This is usually the cdesc, but it can be anything else you want.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Rule for choice-displaying the blending page:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the current page is red-blue:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;Purple.&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if the current page is yellow-blue:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;Green.&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if the current page is yellow-red:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;Orange.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This is useful if you want to simulate several choices that are really just one choice leading to the same page.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Rule for choice-displaying GoToGarden:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the current page is InTheHall:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;Exit the house.&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if the current page is InTheDriveway:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;Take the path to the garden.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 If you want multiple choice on the same page to lead to the same page, it's best to make those pages flip to the desired destination.
<p>
 Section: Choice-Priority
<p>
 As of Version 3, you can now influence choice order by setting choice-priorities. This is useful if you want options to leave menus on the very bottom rather than somewhere awkward like in the very middle.
<p>
 When a choice is elected for selection, it is given a numerical value (by default '50') through the choice-priority rules. The lower the number, the higher it is displayed as a choice.
<p>
 Let's say you always want violence to be the last option. We can pretty easily do that now.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> pkillthem is a page.<br> The cdesc is &quot;Kill them!&quot;<br> The description is &quot;Violence is always the last option.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Choice-priority for pkillthem:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule succeeds with result 200.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 You can do the opposite as well, always putting a choice on top.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> phugthem is a page.<br> The cdesc is &quot;Hug them!&quot;<br> The description is &quot;Shnuggles are always appropriate.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Choice-priority for phugthem:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule succeeds with result 1.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Chapter: Interaction Between CYOA and Model World
<p>
 Hybrid Choices opens the possibility to use the model world in your CYOA projects, and vice-versa. Here's how stuff interacts.
<p>
 Section: In CYOA Mode...
<p>
 Since Hybrid Choice is not always in CYOA mode, it is often helpful to know which mode we are currently in.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">... if in CYOA mode...</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This returns true if we are in CYOA mode. Similarly,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">... if not in CYOA mode...</font></blockquote>
<p>
... returns true if we are playing interactively.
<p>
 Section: Time
<p>
 While Hybrid Choices does allow time to pass (hence making UNDO possible), it suppresses the every turn rulebook. This is generally because these rules are not appropriate in CYOA mode. If you don't like this behavior, you can disable it by unlisting the rule.
<p>
<script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode1003(code) {
    var myProject = project();

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('[=0x000A=]The prevent every turn events rule is not listed in the every turn rulebook.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode1003()"><img border=0 src=inform:/doc_images/paste.png></a><blockquote><font color="#000080"> The prevent every turn events rule is not listed in the every turn rulebook.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section: Moving the Player
<p>
 You'll often find yourself moving the player around the model world during choice mode. This presents a minor problem, as the passage will print twice. In this case, Hybrid Choices uses a particular function to move the player.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">... cyoa teleport to A LOCATION...</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This moves the player without &quot;looking&quot;, thus solving the issue.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A page toggle rule for GoingToSchool:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cyoa teleport to school.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section: CYOA Parser
<p>
 Hybrid Choices allows for a pretty flexible parser. By default, it allows players to make a choice, use the various testing functions (not in final release, of course), basic commands like looking and taking inventory, and the system commands like save, quit, restore, etc. However, you might want to implement new commands in CYOA mode, for example, examining.
<p>
<script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode1004(code) {
    var myProject = project();

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('[=0x000A=]After reading a command when in cyoa mode (this is the accept examining in CYOA rule):[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if the player[=0x0027=]s command includes [=0x0022=]x/examine[=0x0022=], now the command accepted is true.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode1004()"><img border=0 src=inform:/doc_images/paste.png></a><blockquote><font color="#000080"> After reading a command when in cyoa mode (this is the accept examining in CYOA rule):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the player's command includes &quot;x/examine&quot;, now the command accepted is true.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This will allow examining to happen in CYOA mode.
<p>
<script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode1005(code) {
    var myProject = project();

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('[=0x000A=]After reading a command when in cyoa mode (this is the accept examining in CYOA rule):[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if the player[=0x0027=]s command includes [=0x0022=]xyzzy[=0x0022=], now the command accepted is true.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode1005()"><img border=0 src=inform:/doc_images/paste.png></a><blockquote><font color="#000080"> After reading a command when in cyoa mode (this is the accept examining in CYOA rule):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the player's command includes &quot;xyzzy&quot;, now the command accepted is true.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This will allow the player to type in &quot;XYZZY&quot;, so you can code some sort of action in response to it.
<p>
 Unless you set the &quot;command accepted&quot; to true in your own parser rules, they will automatically be rejected in CYOA mode. By default, the error message that's printed is &quot;That command isn't available in choice mode.&quot; but you can change it to whatever you want.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The CYOA error message is &quot;You did wrong, bub.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The reason a text variable is used rather than a response message is simple, sometimes inconsistent error messages can give a clue, say, when the player has to type a password in a certain room.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt; ABCCB</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> That command isn't available in choice mode.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> &gt; XYZZY</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> That command isn't available in CYOA mode.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Use of a text variable ensures consistency in error messages, and avoids giving unintentional clues.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of xyzzying:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the player is not in the colossal cave:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;[cyoa error message][paragraph break]&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;Yeah the cute IF reference works.&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section: Turn To
<p>
 If, by special circumstances, you want to go to a certain page through the use of an action while in choice mode, you'll want to use the &quot;turn to A PAGE&quot; phrase. This phrase causes Hybrid Choices to immediately turn to that page, but still respecting things like page flipping and such.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Instead of xyzzying:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the player is not in the colossal cave:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;[cyoa error message][paragraph break]&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn to the victory page.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 You do not want to use this outside of choice mode, IT WILL NOT WORK. If you want to go into choice mode from interactive mode, use the &quot;switch to cyoa at A PAGE&quot; instead.
<p>
 Section: Items
<p>
 Like Adventure Book, Hybrid Choices makes use of items. Unlike Adventure Book, however, inventory items are not special sorts of flags, they're actual things in the player's inventory and things around them. A key picked up in interactive mode can be used to open a door in choice mode, and vice versa.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> unlockdoor is a page.<br> &quot;You unlock the door with the bronze key.&quot;<br> The cdesc is &quot;Unlock the door.&quot; The required item is the bronze key.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 The &quot;required item&quot; of any give page is the thing that's needed in the player's inventory to reveal it. A page can only have one required item at a time.
<p>
 Similarly, the &quot;canceling item&quot; is an object that suppresses a page if the player is lugging it around.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> hitdoor is a page.<br> &quot;Without a key, you hit the door with futility.&quot;<br> The cdesc is &quot;Hit door.&quot; The canceling item is the bronze key.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Another way you can use items is through the &quot;item-invoking&quot; action. This action allows the player to type the name of a thing in interactive mode, for example, a key, and have that prompt a certain action. By default, item-invoking is disabled. You'll need to activate it by switching the &quot;item-invoking disabled&quot; truth state to false.
<p>
<script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode1006(code) {
    var myProject = project();

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('[=0x000A=]When play begins:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]now item-invoking disabled is false.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode1006()"><img border=0 src=inform:/doc_images/paste.png></a><blockquote><font color="#000080"> When play begins:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now item-invoking disabled is false.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Now you'll need to supply the behaviors when you do item-invoking. By default, it just says &quot;The thing can't be used here.&quot;, which isn't very exciting. There are a couple of applications for it, you can use it for inventory management, or you can use it as a way to interact with objects outside of the player's inventory.
<p>
 This is a very quick example of a system which opens a menu whenever you item-invoke something.
<p>
<script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode1007(code) {
    var myProject = project();

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('[=0x000A=]A thing has an object called the item menu.

<p>
 Section: Note on Flexible Windows
<p>
 If you include Flexible Windows by Jon Ingold, a little choice window is displayed at the bottom of the page. Hybrid Choices will not compile with Flexible Windows version 14 and below.
<p>
 In any case, Hybrid Choices provides you some tools to add a choice window. If you don't use Flexible Windows butsome other interface extension you'll need to provide your own code for each of these three phrases.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> SET CHOICE-WINDOW- This opens the choice-window.<br> UNSET CHOICE-WINDOW- This closes the choice-window.<br> REFRESH CHOICES- This prints the choices to the choice-window.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section: Debug mode
<p>
 Finally, while testing, cyoa debug mode can be toggled on and off by typing &quot;cyoa debug&quot;. This will print all the pages you passed.
<p>
 Chapter: Advanced Topic - Object Choices
<p>
 As of Version 4, there is no restriction on what object can be a choice. This makes Hybrid Choices very powerful in how it can manipulate the model world, and lifts a lot of prior limitations. In Hybrid Choices parlance, an &quot;object choice&quot; is a choice which is not a page.
<p>
 You might be wonder -- what's the point of this? Why would I want objects to be pages? Well, assume you want to an action that brings up all interactive objects in one room as choices. For example, a &quot;list visible objects&quot; command that will let players open a menu of all visible objects that can be examined. Previously, you would need to make a page for each single object, then write page-toggle rules for each of them, and choice-switch rules in case they aren't visible. Object Choices automates what would otherwise be a laborious process.
<p>
 This is all very powerful but comes with the caveat that Hybrid Choices doesn't assume how you want to manipulate object-choices, so some work is necessary to get the full benefit out of them. Once you do, you can use Hybrid Choices to construct action menus, fast travel, node-based conversation systems, or anything, really. &quot;Colored Rooms&quot; and &quot;The Lineup&quot; both present examples of how you could implement object choices.
<p>
 Section: Presenting Objects as Choices
<p>
 Object have to be manually inserted as choices using the POPULATE CHOICE LIST WITH phrase.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> populate choice list with visible people who are not the player.<br> populate choice list with round balls.<br> populate choice list with grandma.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 These place these objects as a choices in the next menu, along with any other pages they might refer to. It's recommended you perform this function with the page-toggle rules.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A page-toggle rule for #killallmartians:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; populate choice list with living martians.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 These options are only valid once, so you need to repopulate them again if you want to use them again.
<p>
 Objects, like pages, can be manipulated using the choice-priority and choice-display.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Choice-priority for a Martian:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rule succeeds with result 1.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Choice-display a Martian (called the poolord):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;Kill [poolord].&quot;</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Section: Handling Objects
<p>
 By default, if an object is chosen, nothing happens. You are simply booted out of cyoa mode. You need to teach Hybrid Choices how to handle object choices.
<p>
 This is mostly done through the General Choose Object rules.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> General choose object rule for a martian (called N):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;You brutally murder the unarmed Martian. Now you feel both safe AND empowered.&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now N is dead.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 This implementation is good enough if your applications are limited. However, Hybrid Choices provides us a method of changing the rulebook to check objects. This rulebook is called the object-choice-handler. Changing the object-choice-handler changes which rulebook is consulted. The one restriction is that these must be object-based rulebooks.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> The murder rules are an object based rulebook.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> A page-toggle rule for #killallmartians:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the object-choice-handler are the murder rules;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; populate choice list with living martians.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Murder a martian (called N):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;You brutally murder the unarmed Martian. Now you feel both safe AND empowered.&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now N is dead.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 One problem. After we've picked an object we are booted to interactive mode, and we might not want that. All we need do is designate a page to go to. We manually change the current page.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> Murder a martian (called N):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say &quot;You brutally murder the unarmed Martian. Now you feel both safe AND empowered.&quot;;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now N is dead;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now the current page is asafespace.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"> asafespace is a page.<br> &quot;Finally. A safe space.&quot;.</font></blockquote>
<p>
 Chapter: Advanced Topic - Memory Economy
<p>
 Hybrid Choices uses more properties and relations than strictly necessary. Much of this is merely convenience, and larger projects might benefit if they comment out certain parts of the extension. It is recommended if you are running into memory issues to copy-paste the extension in to their source code without the folllowing sections-- &quot;section d - page-dependent&quot;. This includes two various-to-various relations and is a major memory hog.
<p>
 Chapter: Reference
<p>
 Section: Action Reference

 Example: *** Temple of Fear - A full, basic game demonstrating a lot of different features.
<p>
 Here is a full example of a game made with Hybrid Choices, in the style of Fighting Fantasy adventure books that some of you might be familiar with. This example doesn't include switching to parser modes, but assumes the whole game will be in CYOA.

 Example: *** Colored Rooms - Implementing a fast travel system using a basic implementation of object choices.
<p>
 This example is a utilitarian example of how CYOA can fit into a mostly parser game. There are only two page objects, but those two page objects are very powerful indeed and we can use them to bring up a menu of options. Importantly, these options are not preseeded, they are made dynamically. As the player explores the map, there are more places to travel to. This would be very difficult with pages alone.
<p>
 In a larger project, you'll want to restrict when the player travels, and what rooms the player can fast travel to. If we have more than 36 options, we'll need to expand the table.

<p>
 Example: **** The Lineup - An advanced implementation of object choices, demonstrating how Hybrid CYOA can be used to make a very powerful interface.
<p>
 This example doesn't include parser mode, but it does something that would be very cumbersome and laborious using just pages. The lineup has five people, and through those people the game state is tracked.
<p>
 Normally, you'd use pages for every single option. For each person, you'd need to include an examine page, step-forward, step-back, say-line and accuse, and then check and toggle rules for each one of those. Object choices simplifies this by allowing us to directly insert characters as choices. We can then apply rules to each of them directly. This saves us a lot of horribly boring work. It also makes it very easy to add additional characters; we don't need to add any new pages at all, we can just define a new person, their sayline rule, their accuse rule, and be done with it. You might see how this is useful in large projects.
