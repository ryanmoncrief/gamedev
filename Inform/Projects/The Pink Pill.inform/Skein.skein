Often times when a case looks particularly difficult, or when the local police force can't be bothered to do their jobs correctly, they call you in to provide some insight. While most of their "cases" rarely merit a second thought, this one intrigues you. A suicide, but so obviously not so, perplexing. You arrived onto the scene mere hours after the police discovered the body, and you get to begin the investigation before the Medical Examiner even arrived. One of the perks of having the chief detective inspector owe you a favor. Now it is just you and the murder. The game is afoot.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Worse news, the police haven't even had time to identify the body yet, so It's up to you to figure this out quickly. The killer is likely looking for an escape, and you ought to find them before they get away.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Often times when a case looks particularly difficult, or when the local police force can't be bothered to do their jobs correctly, they call you in to provide some insight. While most of their "cases" rarely merit a second thought, this one intrigues you. A suicide, but so obviously not so, perplexing. You arrived onto the scene mere hours after the police discovered the body, and you get to begin the investigation before the Medical Examiner even arrived. One of the perks of having the chief detective inspector owe you a favor. Now it is just you and the murder. The game is afoot.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Worse news, the police haven't even had time to identify the body yet, so It's up to you to figure this out quickly. The killer seems to have taken anything off of the body that he deemed valuable or important. They are likely looking for an escape, and you ought to find them before they get away. &#x000A;One interesting thing you find, however is that her fingers look ragged, and there are some scratches on the floor next to her hand.&#x000A;&#x000A;After a good bit of squinting, you see the name "RACHEL" appear carved into the ground.
